Metric Learning for Kernel Regression
=====================================

Download and install [MLKR](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kilian/code/code.html) (Matlab).

Run:

	mlkr_rescale_separately.m
	rf_mlkr_rescaled_separately.r
	
	mlkr_rescale_together.m
	rf_mlkr_rescaled_together.r

The first script transforms the dataset, the second trains a random forest.

The rescaling method doesn't seem to matter with this dataset.
